# Theory of Programming Languages 2015/16

This repository contains materials for the Theory of Programming Languages course (*Teorija programskih jezikov*) at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.

## Contents

### microhaskell

The *microhaskell* folder contains the code for the MicroHaskell language, a fragment of Haskell being developed for teaching purposes. It is written in Haskell.

* The *mh-original* branch contains the files with basic functionality that serve as a starting point for the tutorials.
* The *mh-modified* branch contains the files with additional features as added on the tutorials. This branch will usually be merged with *master*.

### lmh

The *lmh* folder contains the code for LMH, which is MicroHaskell with type inferrence.

### homework1

The *homework1* folder contains the files for the first homework. The [handout](https://ucilnica.fmf.uni-lj.si/mod/resource/view.php?id=16922) is available on Moodle.

### homework2
